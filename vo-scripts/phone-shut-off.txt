ok so my phone was probably overheating but basically it turned off again and i didn't realize until it was too late

basically as a reconstruction of the lost footage, i was pretty much just cruising up the transitway until
out of fucking nowhere a battery bus running the 44 route suddenly appeared on an entranace ramp to the side
i realized i could quickly catch it at the next station, and so i fixed my phone up and made the move
