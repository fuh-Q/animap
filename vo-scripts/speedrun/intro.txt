so first off this bus turned out to be really packed so i wasn't going to talk that much anyways

so we're here in ottawa, OC Transpo, which is our transit agency, runs 9 different models of buses and trains on their fixed routes

today's challenge is to hit up every model in the fastest time, and while i don't have a time goal set, some other people have done this challenge in under 2 hours,
so ideally i'd be able to beat that time

we've now boarded the 73 towards Tunney's Pasture running on a 2010-built D60LFR, and this checks off our first vehicle of the run
this was actually kind of a suboptimal move which i'll explain why later, but for this bus it's gonna be a quick one-stop ride over to
Tunney's where we'll get a line 1 train heading east
