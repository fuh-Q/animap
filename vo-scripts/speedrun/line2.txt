also thing with line 2 that it runs on 12 minute headways because of single tracking,
so with two types of trains on the line, having to skip a train because it isn't the right model
will set me back hard, hence why i'm so uncertain about it

i got pretty lucky here tho, and could actually hear a LINT pulling in downstairs, and this is the rarer model on line 2
so i'm pretty happy about that
