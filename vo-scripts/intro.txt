so first off this bus turned out to be really packed so i wasn't gonna be talking much anyways

so we're here in ottawa, OC Transpo, which is our transit agency, runs 9 different models of buses and trains on their fixed routes

today's challenge is to hit up every model in the fastest time, and while i don't have a time goal set, some other people have done this in under 2 hours,
so ideally i'd be able to beat that time

starting at Westboro Station, we've just boarded a 2010-built D60LFR headed for Tunney's Pasture, and this checks off our first vehicle type of the run.
Tunney's is one of OC Transpo's largest interchange stations and therefore a no-brainer to head there first,
and the plan from there is to catch an eastbound train on line 1, since at this point it makes the most sense to move more or less towards downtown
